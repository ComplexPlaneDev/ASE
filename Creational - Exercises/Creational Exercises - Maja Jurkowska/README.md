# Creational Pattern Exercises - Maja Jurkowska

**Language:** Java

## Structure 

- Abstract Factory/exe01-03

- Builder/exe01-03

- Factory Method/exe01-03

- Prototype/exe01-03

### Each Exercise folder will contain:

- `pattern.md` with an explanation why i think this patter fits.

- Java code showing the design.

## Rules 

Rules I will follow from Professor's README:

- Focusing on class design first - not mandatory to fully implement each property.

- Each exercise will be a single commit.

- For large exercises - the minimum is 2 components and 2 types.

- No need for business logic; simple print is fine.

- Picking the most suitable pattern.

- Singleton is optional, but can be added anywhere if meaningful (doesn't have to be a thread safe design).
