# Problem Description

You are designing a **Travel Itinerary Planning System** for a travel agency platform. The system needs to create comprehensive travel itineraries with various components and activities. Each itinerary can have multiple optional elements, and the construction process should be flexible enough to create different types of travel experiences based on traveler preferences.

## Requirements

### Itinerary Components

A travel itinerary can contain the following optional components:

- **Trip Information**: Destination, dates, duration, traveler details
- **Flights**: Departure and arrival flights with multiple segments
- **Accommodations**: Hotels, hostels, vacation rentals with different amenities
- **Transportation**: Local transport (rental cars, public transit, transfers)
- **Travel Documents**: Visa requirements, insurance, emergency contacts

### Itinerary Types

The system should support different types of travel itineraries:

1. **Adventure Itinerary**: Focus on outdoor activities, adventure sports, and exploration
2. **Business Itinerary**: Business meetings, conferences, networking events, efficient travel
3. **Family Itinerary**: Kid-friendly activities, family accommodations, flexible scheduling

Design a solution where itinerary components and types can be mixed without the clients knowing the details of the each itinerary component.
