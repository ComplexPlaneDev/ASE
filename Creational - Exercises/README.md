## Rules

- There are 3 exercises for each Creational Pattern: Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Builder and Prototype. You need to figure out which one fits bets that specific problem.

- There's no exercise involving the Singleton Pattern, but it can be added to any of the other patterns. Try to find out a way to add it, if possible, not mandatory. It doesn't have to be a thread-safe design.

- When using the Builder pattern, up to you if you want to use the Method Chaining approach. It's considered a valid solution.

- Use any programming language you like

- IMPORTANT: You don't need to implement all the properties of each class, it's up to you. The goal of the exercise is to focus on the class design. Example: the TravelItinerary exercise has 5 components and 3 types to implement, you don't have to implement them all, if you're not willing to. The bare minimum is 2 components and 2 types. The exercise has been designed to give it a meaningful context, but you don't have to be complete from the implementation POV.

- You don't need to implement any logic, the design is the goal. The implementation of each specific method can be as simple as a normal message printed on the screen, implement just the minimum amount of logic you need to implement your solution. How complex is the implementation is again up to you, but focus on the design first.

- Ideally you should solve at least one exercise for all possible pattern types. Up to you if you want to do more. Try to implement AT LEAST one fully.

- You don't need to write any documentation, but, as I have to review it, please be clear in the code, or put comments if you like, that will help me a lot.

## Solution deploy

- Fork [ASE](https://github.com/ComplexPlaneDev/ASE)
- You could create a branch to work on, up to you
- Create a folder in the "Creational - Exercises" folder, that will contain your work (please use a kind of unique name for this folder, let's say, a team name, your name or something similar), you can create all subfolders you like, up to you.
- Create a single commit for each exercise.
- Push to your github repo and then do a Pull Request vs. ASE containing all your commits. In your PR please write your name or, if you're on a team, please write the team members names.
