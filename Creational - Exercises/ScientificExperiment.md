## Problem Description

You are developing a system for a research laboratory that conducts various types of scientific experiments. The laboratory frequently runs similar experiments with slight variations in parameters such as temperature, pressure, duration, and sample types.

Calculating all parameters for each experiment has a high cost, that must be taken into account for the solution design.

## Requirements

### Base Experiment Types

- **Chemical Analysis Experiment**: Has properties like chemical compounds, reaction temperature, pH level, and duration
- **Biology Culture Experiment**: Has properties like organism type, growth medium, incubation temperature, and observation period
- **Physics Material Testing**: Has properties like material type, stress levels, environmental conditions, and measurement intervals
