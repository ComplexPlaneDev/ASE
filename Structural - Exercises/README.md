## Rules

- There is one exercise for each Structural Pattern (but Facade).

- Use any programming language you like, some interfaces definitions are written in Java, but you can translate them in the language you wish.

- IMPORTANT: You don't need to implement all the properties of each class, it's up to you. The goal of the exercise is to focus on the class design.

- You don't need to implement any logic, the design is the goal. The implementation of each specific method can be as simple as a normal message printed on the screen, implement just the minimum amount of logic you need to implement your solution. How complex is the implementation is again up to you, but focus on the design first.

- Ideally you should solve all exercises. Try to implement AT LEAST one fully.

- You don't need to write any documentation, but, as I have to review it, please be clear in the code, or put comments if you like, that will help me a lot.

## Solution deploy

- Fork [ASE](https://github.com/ComplexPlaneDev/ASE)
- You could create a branch to work on, up to you
- Create a folder in the "Structural - Exercises" folder, that will contain your work (please use a kind of unique name for this folder, let's say, a team name, your name or something similar), you can create all subfolders you like, up to you.
- Create a single commit for each exercise.
- Push to your github repo and then do a Pull Request vs. ASE containing all your commits. In your PR please write your name or, if you're on a team, please write the team members names.
